Repository SOEN6611_TeamS contains Projects folder inside it. This folder contains all the Projects inside it.

This folder contains three projects: commons-collections, commons-configuration, commons-io , one configuration file, spearman_output and a script called get-pip.py

The configuration file contains the plugins used for configuring jacoco and pitest, instructions to run cloc tool, how to calculate spearman coefficient in IntelliJ IDE.

Along with contains the get-pip.py script which is used to helpful in finding spearman coefficient. This script is used to install pip library which further helps to install SciPy library. Using the inbuilt functions of this libraray we can find the spearman coefficient and p-value. We have explained the steps in the config file.

Each of the commons folder contains Data collection folder inside it.

Now inside the commons-collections folder we have:
- bugs: It contains the excel sheets with all the bugs retrieved from Issue tracking system
- code_churn_defect_density: It contains an excel file with defect density and code churn calculated.
- jacoco: It contains the reports retrieved for branch and statement in csv, html, xml form for each of the version we have used in this project.
- pitest: It contains pit reports for all the versions of the project.
- CodeChurn.txt file contains the code churn data which was retrieved by running CLOC tool.
- SizeOfRelease.txt file contains the size of release using CLOC tool.
- Graphs.doc file contains the graphs we plotted for the spearman coefficient for each of the project. 

Projects folder also contains the spearman coefficient and p-values calculated for all the projects. 
Similar structure is followed by commons-configuration and commons-io folders.
