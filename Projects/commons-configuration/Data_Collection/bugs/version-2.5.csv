IniConfiguration.getSection() behaves inconsistently regarding dot escaping,CONFIGURATION-749,13237502,Bug,Open,CONFIGURATION,Commons Configuration,software,issues@commons.apache.org,,http://commons.apache.org/configuration/,Major,Unresolved,,McNetic,McNetic,6/4/2019 13:50,6/4/2019 13:50,6/19/2019 19:00,,2.5,Expression engine,,0,"According to documentation, dots in Keys should be escaped by doubling them. IniConfiguration.getSection() does not always recognise this correctly: When the section already exists, it works as expected. When the section does not exist, escaping is ignored, so

getSection(""section.with.dots"") will create a section called section.with.dots (consequently, getSection(""section..with..dots"") creates a sectoin called section..with..dots).

Additionally, the section return by the former call does behave strangely; it will only accept one call to addProperty().",,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,9.22337E+18,,,50:24.0,,,,,,0|z03eio:,9.22337E+18,,,,,,,,
