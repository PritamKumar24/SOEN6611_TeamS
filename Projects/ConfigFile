 Instructions to run the CLOC tools –
•	Install the latest version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en
•	Download the CLOC python script by using command -  npm install -g cloc
•	CLOC is tool written in python. 
•	To run this tool the system should be python enabled
•	To make the system python enabled we need to install two python development kits.
•	Install “ActiveState Perl” – to recognize the perl.
•	Installation of Strawberry Perl – to make CLOC executable
•	This will make the CLOC executable.
3. Commands to obtain the results –
1. To get the total lines of code – cloc path\projectname
2. To get the code churn between different versions of project – cloc  - -diff path\Project_Name_Version_A path \Project_Name_Version_B

4. Instructions to run the SciPy script for spearman correlation –
•	Install the python IDE - Idle (Python GUI)
•	Download the python script file get-pip.py to install the pip library
•	This script will be used to run the scipy script which is used to run the spearman script
Commands to run the SciPy script –
•	Path\python get-pip.py
•	Path\python -m pip install scipy
To obtain the spearman coefficient results –
•	Stats.spearmanr([‘comma_separated_values_of_varibale_1’],[comma_separated_values_of_varibale_2])
